## Description

This lab was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You you have a React App scaffolding to start with but you will need to run `npm install` to download all its dependencies (takes some time).

Your App will have the following components structure. Create a file per component in a folder `src/Components/`

* Visualized as a component tree

![components tree](./readme/component_tree.png)

* Visualized as a list

![components list](./readme/components.png)


* Think about how this components tree matches what a user will see in the screen.
* How many children will `App` have and who are they?
* Import the children of `App` into `App.js` and use them.
