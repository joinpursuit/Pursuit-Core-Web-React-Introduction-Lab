## Description

This lab was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You you have a React App scaffolding to start with but you will need to run `npm install` to download all its dependencies (takes some time).

Your App will have the following components structure.
Create a file per component in a `src/Components/` folder, like `src/Components/NavBar.js`.

> Jest tests assume your components are set up in that structure with the same names from the diagram.

* Visualized as a component tree

* Visualized as a list

* Think about how this components tree matches what a user will see in the screen.
* How many children will `App` have and who are they?
* Import the children of `App` into `App.js` and use them.
